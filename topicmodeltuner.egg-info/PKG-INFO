# TopicTuner &#8212; Tune BERTopic HDBSCAN Models

## The Problem
Out of the box, BERTopic relies upon HDBSCAN to cluster topics. Two of the most important HDBSCAN parameters, 
min_cluster_size and sample_size will almost always have a dramatic effect on cluster formation. These parameters greatly effect the number of clusters created as well as the the number of documents assigned to the -1 category. 
The default parameters will, more often than not, result in an unmanageable number
of topics. Additionally, documents assigned to the -1 category will not be used to determine topic vocabularly results. 

## The Solution
TopicTuner provides a TopicModelTuner class&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;a convenience wrapper for BERTopic Models that efficiently manages 
the process of discovering optimized min_cluster_size and sample_size parameters, providing:

- Random and grid search functionality to discover optimized parameters for a given BERTopic model.
- A datastore that records all searches for a given model.
- Visualizations to assist in parameter tuning and selection.
- 'Import/Export' functionality to both wrap existing BERTopic models and to provide a BERTopic model tuned with the 
optimized parameters.
- Save and Load for persistance.

To get you started this release includes both a [demo notebook](https://github.com/drob-xx/TopicTuner/blob/main/TopicTunerDemo.ipynb) and [API documentation](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/drob-xx/TopicTuner/blob/main/doc/topictuner.html)
